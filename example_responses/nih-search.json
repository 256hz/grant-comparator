Mammalian sex\nchromosomes are enriched for rapidly evolving large palindromic sequences harboring testis-specific genes.\nHowever, the mechanism driving rapid evolution of X- and Y- palindromes and their associated genes is poorly\nunderstood. I propose that intra-palindrome gene conversion – the “copying” of sequence from one palindrome\narm to the other via recombination – is the primary mechanism driving X- and Y- palindrome evolution. The\npremise of this proposal is based upon observations from my recently published findings in mouse and previous\nstudies in primates that X- and Y-palindromes, respectively, undergo on-going intra-palindrome gene conversion.\nTo address the rapid evolution of X- and Y-palindromic sequences, I will first identify whether selective pressures\n(i.e. positive or purifying selection) influence the sequence evolution of X- and Y- palindromes in mice. This will\nbe the first systematic analysis of both X- and Y-palindrome sequence evolution within a single species to\nunderstand the selective pressures governing their evolution. I will also develop a novel assay to address, for\nthe first time, the in vivo frequencies of X- and Y- intra-palindrome gene conversion. Understanding the evolution\nof X- and Y- palindromes and in vivo frequencies of intra-palindrome gene conversion will provide valuable\ninsights into the rapid evolution of genomic regions important for male fertility.",

When dysregulated, these pathways can contribute to\nbrain pathologies including brain tumors. We determined that one biosynthetic pathway involving GTP\ncyclohydrolase I (GCH1) as the rate-limiting step contributes to the growth of brain tumors and is elevated in\nthe neoplastic stem cell subpopulation. In patient sample datasets, increased levels of GCH1 also correlate\nwith poor outcomes. These data suggest the importance of understanding the biological and molecular roles of\nGCH1. We have therefore proposed to determine if GCH1 is critical for regulating reactive species balance in\nglioma and maintaining neoplastic stem cell characteristics. Potential novel downstream mediators of GCH1\neffects will be validated. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of GCH1 will determine if targeting of GCH1 is\nsufficient to decrease glioma growth alone or in combination with standard of care. We anticipate these studies\nwill determine if GCH1 or another molecule in the same biosynthetic pathway should be a further investigated\nas a biomarker for either outcome or therapeutic response. We hope that our studies will provide a greater\nunderstanding of the mechanisms through which metabolism is altered in brain disease and inform future novel\ntreatment strategies.",

            "abstract_text": "﻿   \nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most studies of human genomic variation, nutrition, and metabolic traits have focused on non- African populations. However, Africa is an important region to study as it is the site of origin of modern humans. Africa contains the greatest levels o human genetic variation and is the source of the worldwide range expansion of modern humans to regions outside of Africa. Several common complex diseases of metabolic origin, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases occur at higher frequency in African Americans, and are on the rise in urban centers in Africa. It has been postulated that this\nis due to genetic variants adaptive for past environments with intermittent access to food but maladaptive in nutritionally replete \"Westernized\" environments. Metabolomics technology has begun to provide insight into metabolic processes and can be used for biomarker identification for disease risk and provide insight into metabolic pathways associated with risk. Given the intimate relationship between nutrition and metabolism and subsequent disease risk, metabolomics provides a unique and powerful tool in nutritional research. In this proposal, we will exploit metabolomic profiling to interrogate extant plasma from a unique set of ethnically diverse, well phenotyped indigenous African populations who practice different subsistence patterns (agriculture, pastoralism, agro- pastoralism, and hunting-gathering) who vary markedly in markers of cardiometabolic risk. We will perform untargeted metabolomics profiling in a sample of 365 individuals and will do targeted profiling of informative metabolites in a sample of 1500 ethnically diverse Africans to identify differences in metabolites and metabolic pathways that correlate with diet and anthropometric and cardiovascular phenotypes associated with disease risk. We will integrate these data with a large genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and whole genome sequence dataset collected in the same individuals to gain insight into how genetic, nutritional and other environmental factors contribute to variation in cardiometabolic risk traits in ethnically diverse African populations.",

However, Africa is an important region to study as it is the site of origin of modern humans. Africa contains the greatest levels o human genetic variation and is the source of the worldwide range expansion of modern humans to regions outside of Africa. Several common complex diseases of metabolic origin, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases occur at higher frequency in African Americans, and are on the rise in urban centers in Africa. It has been postulated that this\nis due to genetic variants adaptive for past environments with intermittent access to food but maladaptive in nutritionally replete \"Westernized\" environments. Metabolomics technology has begun to provide insight into metabolic processes and can be used for biomarker identification for disease risk and provide insight into metabolic pathways associated with risk. Given the intimate relationship between nutrition and metabolism and subsequent disease risk, metabolomics provides a unique and powerful tool in nutritional research. In this proposal, we will exploit metabolomic profiling to interrogate extant plasma from a unique set of ethnically diverse, well phenotyped indigenous African populations who practice different subsistence patterns (agriculture, pastoralism, agro- pastoralism, and hunting-gathering) who vary markedly in markers of cardiometabolic risk. We will perform untargeted metabolomics profiling in a sample of 365 individuals and will do targeted profiling of informative metabolites in a sample of 1500 ethnically diverse Africans to identify differences in metabolites and metabolic pathways that correlate with diet and anthropometric and cardiovascular phenotypes associated with disease risk. We will integrate these data with a large genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and whole genome sequence dataset collected in the same individuals to gain insight into how genetic, nutritional and other environmental factors contribute to variation in cardiometabolic risk traits in ethnically diverse African populations.",

However, Africa is an important region to study as it is the site of origin of modern humans. Africa contains the greatest levels o human genetic variation and is the source of the worldwide range expansion of modern humans to regions outside of Africa. Several common complex diseases of metabolic origin, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases occur at higher frequency in African Americans, and are on the rise in urban centers in Africa. It has been postulated that this\r\nis due to genetic variants adaptive for past environments with intermittent access to food but maladaptive in nutritionally replete \"Westernized\" environments. Metabolomics technology has begun to provide insight into metabolic processes and can be used for biomarker identification for disease risk and provide insight into metabolic pathways associated with risk. Given the intimate relationship between nutrition and metabolism and subsequent disease risk, metabolomics provides a unique and powerful tool in nutritional research. In this proposal, we will exploit metabolomic profiling to interrogate extant plasma from a unique set of ethnically diverse, well phenotyped indigenous African populations who practice different subsistence patterns (agriculture, pastoralism, agro- pastoralism, and hunting-gathering) who vary markedly in markers of cardiometabolic risk. We will perform untargeted metabolomics profiling in a sample of 365 individuals and will do targeted profiling of informative metabolites in a sample of 1500 ethnically diverse Africans to identify differences in metabolites and metabolic pathways that correlate with diet and anthropometric and cardiovascular phenotypes associated with disease risk. We will integrate these data with a large genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and whole genome sequence dataset collected in the same individuals to gain insight into how genetic, nutritional and other environmental factors contribute to variation in cardiometabolic risk traits in ethnically diverse African populations.   \r\n   \r\n",
